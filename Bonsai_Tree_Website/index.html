            <h2>HISTORY AND ORIGIN</h2>
        </strong>
        
        <p>
            The word “Bon-sai” is Japanese translated meaning “plant in a container”.  This type of botanical care is derived from an ancient Chinese horticultural practice which was redeveloped under that practice of Japanese Zen Buddhism.  By year 700 the Chinese had started the art of “pun-sai” using special techniques to grow dwarf trees in containers.  Originally only the elite of the society practiced pun-tsai with native-collected specimens and the trees where throughout China as luxurious gifts.  In the Kamakura period, the period in which Japan adopted most of China’s cultural trademarks, the art of growing trees in containers was introduced into Japan.
        </p>

        <p>
            Over the centuries, different regional styles would be developed throughout the large country with its many various landscapes; earthenware and ceramic containers would replace the porcelain ones displayed on wooden stands; and attempts would be made to shape the trees with bamboo frameworks or brass wire or lead strips.  After the 16th century these were called pun tsai or “tray planting.”  The term pun Ching (“tray landscape,” now called Penjing) didn’t actually come into usage until the 17th century.
        </p>

        </strong>
        
        <p>
            It is believed that the first tray landscapes were from China to Japan at least twelve hundred years ago.  A thousand years ago, the first lengthy work of fiction in Japanese included this passage: “A full-sized tree that is left growing in its natural state is a crude thing.  It is only when it is kept close to human beings who fashion it with loving care that its shape and style acquire the ability to move one”.

                    Taking care of these plants can be challenging but many people enjoy the challenge due to the encouragement of paying close attention to it and learn about it.  A high level of care can help the owners form a strong bond with their trees.  Even develop strong affection for Bonsai trees.

                    Bonsai trees also provide a sense of accomplishment when forgoing the growing process thanks to the hard work.  Caring for these trees require a investing in time and commitment like any job.

            <p>
                People grow them because they represent balance and promote reflection on that balance for those who care for it.  This is due to the tree itself, being on a thin line between being over-watered and under-watered; over-fed and under-fed, as well as it not having enough space or too much space.  This forces the owner to keep the plant in the center of those very extremes.  Keeping one is an excellent way of being aware of the ebb and flow of life.

                Caring for the Bonsai tree will help the owner gain a better sense of patience and a slowness that is in contrast to the rush and chaos of everyday life.  Because Bonsai trees always grow slow because the roots are kept in constricted conditions.  The slow and steady way of growing it helps foster a better appreciation of the growth that it achieves over time and gives the planter time to hones their patience.

                There are meditative benefits.  As someone spends hours contemplating their bonsai, they become aware of how much impact it has.  They are often used in zen gardens or other tranquil areas to inspired deep thought and physical stillness.  To the owner, the rest of the world would seem like it’s falling away and focus is on the tree, which has a calming effect.  Slow down and disconnect while caring for one of these beautiful plants is a great way to gain a sense of achievement without the pressures and stress of the world’s intrusion.

                Bonsai trees also enhance the aesthetics of your home.  They look great in practically any setting.  As the tree makes your home more beautiful and unique it does a great job of promoting a calm and soothing atmosphere.  Therefore, reducing stress levels on a daily basis, especially when it is placed where you can see it all times and enjoy it.

            <h2>CARE</h2>
        </strong>
        <p>
            Even though Bonsai trees are more delicate than the average indoor plant, a few basic rules should enable anyone to take care of their tree.  Be careful of how you water and place it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Decide on an optimal spot to place your Bonsai.  Consider local climate, time of year, etc.  For indoor locations, a South facing window will do well for it.  Make sure that it is in a spot where it has a lot of light.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            For the outdoors, find the brightest spot.  Summer will be the best time for lots of light.
        </p>
            
        
        <p>
            Watering the Bonsai depends on the different species of the plant, size of the tree, size of the container, time of the year, soil, and climate.  Water your tree when the soil is slightly dry.  Never water on a routine.  Keep a close eye on year trees to determine when each one needs watering.  Do not water all of your plants on daily routine.  Utilize the right soil-mixture.  Most Bonsai trees thrive on a mixture of akadama, pumice, and lava rock in a ratio of ½ to ¼ .
        </p>

        <p>
            Regular fertilization during the growing season is crucial for your tree.  Since Bonsai are confined rather than out in the open like other trees, they require proper fertilization to restore the soil’s nutrients.
